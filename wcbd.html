                <p>
                    In order to assist youths and young adults from staying homeless, we need to provide an environment that adheres to
                     the physical and emotional comfort of the youth.  We need to understand the challenges that homeless youths face in order 
                     to give the support they need.  Here are a few things that should be accessible to the homeless youths and young adults: 
                </p>

                <h3>Community-based programs:</h3>
                <p>Many homeless youths are not well informed about the law and what rights they have.  Providing programs that educate 
                    such information can prepare homeless youths to arm themselves and navigate their governmental system and if needed,
                    seek out legal representation (Schmitz & Pampel, 2016).
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Having community programs that are facilitated through schools can help the prevention of youths running away or 
                    being kicked out from home in the first place by providing certain services for the student and their family.
                </p>
                <p>
                Youth leadership programs can build community and respect between those who experience homelessness and those who do not.
                 It is known that these youth leadership programs “establish comfort and reduce power differentials at the focus groups” 
                 and therefore can create a safe space to speak about their experiences knowing that they will not be judged and even 
                 receive advice from others (Pk, 2018).  This can build communication skills and enforce empowerment among the youths who
                  were experiencing homelessness.  
                </p>

                <h3>Trauma-based intervention:</h3>
                <p>
                    It is important to provide shelter-based mental health clinics for homeless youths.  However, it is very important to 
                    realize that youths will most likely only attend the first few sessions of treatment, abruptly ending the course of 
                    long-term treatment plans, whether the reason being is to move on to the next city, or to prioritize looking for jobs. 
                     Therefore, on top of providing easy access to shelter-based mental health clinics, there needs to be interventions 
                     that can create a pathway to long-term care (Winiarski, et al., 2020). Using technology such as preloaded cell phones
                      as a mode of communication to therapists and counselors can be one example of how to do this.
                </p>

                <h3>Housing programs:</h3>
                <p>
                    Providing youths with long term housing programs can ease the stress of constantly seeking safe spots to sleep outside.
                    And providing housing programs that specifically assists in addressing concerns about building their independence and 
                    self-sufficiency is important since a lot of homeless youths, and any other young people, have to deal with the
                    pressures of becoming independent but also expecting to follow rules created by adults (Winiarski, et al., 2020).
                    Providing housing programs for underrepresented communities such as the LGBTQ or for people of color can also 
                    decrease the likelyhood of facing discrimination as well
                </p>

                <h3>What Can You Do?</h3>
                <p>
                    Organizations that create these programs are in need for funding and volunteers who serve the homeless youth community
                     in order to continue their support.  So, whether participating in their fundraisers/charities or signing up to be a 
                     part of the organization in any shape or form (full-time, part-time, or even for just a day) can really make a 
                     difference.
