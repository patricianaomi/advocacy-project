                <p>Every day, the homeless population is rising in Washington state.  With limited amounts of shelters and health centers, people are left to survive in unsafe and inhumane environments.  
                    Unfortunately, a big amount of the homeless population consists of youths.  There are many extra challenges that homeless youths have to deal with when they are not provided with a stable home.   
                    It is very heart wrenching to see that young people are not being given the proper care they need, while they make a very important transition into their adult life.   
                    The purpose of this website is to spread awareness and advocate for youths and young adults who are experiencing homelessness.</p>
