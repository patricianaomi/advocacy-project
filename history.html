                <h4>
                    Homelessness can have multiple negative effects on youths and young adult’s mental, physical 
                    and social well-being.  
                </h4>

                <h3>Safety Issues:</h3>
                <p>
                    Youths and young adults who are homeless have an increased risk for experiencing gender-based violence. An article 
                    shares an undocumented queer young person’s experience who trades sex with adults in order to find a place to stay
                     as well as not face identification checks, harrassment and fights at youth shelters; she also mentions of how a
                      young Black women had to move in with an abusive partner because her home was unstable and overcrowded (Pk, 2018).  
                </p>

                <h3>Substance Abuse:</h3>
                <p>
                    Resorting to substance abuse is also another factor that can negatively impact homeless young people.  Young people
                     who experience homelessness are more likely to abuse substances than those who do not experience it (Heerde, et al., 2020).  Drugs and
                      alcohol may be consumed in order to cope with the daily stressors homeless youths and young adults must face.  
                      Dealing drugs can also be a means to a source of income regardless if it increases their risk of violent 
                      altercations with other adults or the police.

                </p>

                <h3>Psychological Trauma:</h3>
                <p>
                    Experiencing multiple traumatic events often leads homeless youths to have mental health issues.  A study found
                     that both depression and trauma were the most common mental health concerns youths were suffering from (Winiarski, et al., 2020).  A 
                     separate study found that young adults who were experiencing homelessness were more likely to experience suicidal 
                     thoughts and/or resort deliberate self-harm (Heerde, et al., 2020).  However, because homeless youths and young adults have a hard time 
                     trusting mental or physical care facilities and refrain from seeking out help.  They also may prioritize other 
                     endeavors such as attempting to find a job or finish school while being homeless which creates an obstacle for 
                     them to get the care they need. 
                </p>

                <h3>Physical Health Issues:</h3>
                <p>
                    Youths and young adults who are homeless tend to fail to meet basic nutritional requirements. This leaves them to
                     be at risk for developing certain health issues such as “obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular 
                     diseases associated with poor nutrition” (Hatsu, et al., 2019).  They are also highly at risk for sexually transmitted diseases(STDs) and 
                     human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) due to sexual victimization, survival sex or not using protecion (Caccamo & Kachur & Williams, 2017).
