                <h4>The recorded number of homeless youth and young adults in King County 
                    alone in 2019 has an estimate of 1,089 and this number does not account for those who have children or are in families (All Home King County, 2020). 
                    There are many factors that lead youths and young adults to homelessness...  
                </h4>

                <h3>Family Conflict, Abuse & Rejection:</h3>
                <p>The most common reason for homelessness among youths and young adults stems from childhood. When children are faced with
                     neglect, rejection, physical, mental or sexual abuse, they may result to running away from home for their own safety. 
                     One of the main causes of family rejection is from identity-based issues. When young people from the LGBTQ+ community 
                     who come out to their family and find themselves no longer welcome, they are forced to move out of their homes regardless 
                     of whether they have a place to stay. This makes them the most prevalent cause of homelessness (Abramovich, et al., 2016).

                </p>

                <h3>Discrimination:</h3>
                <p>
                    Young adults may have a hard time finding job opportunities, affordable housing or educational success due to discrimination 
                    towards race, sex and or class can result in a young adult to experience homelessless. In King County, Washington, it is 
                    common for youth of color to experience homelessness at higher rates compared to white youths (Pk, 2018)  On top of that,
                     young adults who are already homeless can encounter discrimination against their homeless status, thus making it difficult 
                     to come out of being homeless.  
                </p>

                <h3>Economic Instability:</h3>
                <p>
                    If a childâ€™s family is suffering from poverty, they could find it difficult to afford certain needs such as educational, food
                     and medical expenses. A survey found that families with children were more likely to encounter an increase in rent 
                     (All Home King County, 2020). Other factors
                      such as living in a single parent household, being of an underrepresented racial group and substance abuse can result in 
                      families having to leave their homes and move around in shelters, thus leading youths and young adults to become homeless. 
                </p>

                <h3>Involvement in the Childcare System: </h3>
                <p>
                    High rates of children who grow out of the foster care system find themselves with limited resources and are unable to find 
                    stable jobs and/or continue their education, resulting in them to experience homelessness as young adults.  A study has 
                    shown that over 50% of young adults who have been in the foster care system or juvenile justice system have experienced
                     homelessness (Narendorf., et al, 2020)
